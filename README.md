lorca starter 

Uses the following web tools:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)

`postcss` and `cssnano` are used to optionally compress css if needed.

`Make` is used to build rather than *npm*. No *package.json* file is used.

## Usage

Run once:

    $ make dep
    $ make webtools

Build and test:

    $ make clean
    $ make

See the comments in *Makefile*.
